# Extended mathematical operations test

# Polynomial examples (already working)
poly1 = x * x + 2 * x + 1
poly2 = x * x * x - 3 * x + 2

# Trigonometric operations (would need parser updates)
# trig1 = sin(x)
# trig2 = cos(x * x)
# trig3 = tan(2 * x + 1)

# Differential operations (would need parser updates)  
# diff1 = diff(x * x)
# diff2 = diff(x * x * x + 2 * x)

# Combined operations
combined1 = 2 * x * x + 3 * x + 5
combined2 = x * x * x * x - x * x + 1
